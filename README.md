## Instructions
Tonight you will be creating a React front-end for the Cookbook API we completed yesterday. For tonights homework feel free to use your code from yesterday or if you would like a clean solution we have provided one [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SEIR-831/Cookbook-API/tree/solution)

## Requirements

1. React front-end that utilizes each route we created yesterday
2. Exact architecture is up to you! So have fun creating interesting ways to use the data
    

## Tips
- Start by hosting your backend first
- BABY STEPS test each component and route as you go
- Use console.logs to make sure you are getting the data you expect
- Don't worry about how it looks until everything else is done

## Bonus
- Host your react front-end as well
